In a world driven by technology and data, my 17-year odyssey stands as a beacon of innovation at the nexus of geoscience, business strategy, and the vast realm of data science and AI. Grounded in a rigorous STEM education, I've melded the precision of geoscience with the cutting-edge advancements in machine learning and AI, crafting solutions that align with the ethos of today's tech giants. Data science methodology, from business to analytics approach, is a must in my professional skills.

My journey in the energy sector wasn't just about understanding the earth's layers; it was about mining the data, extracting insights, and forecasting with machine intelligence. Proudly, I played a role in the team that unveiled the hydrocarbon pre-salt's largest accumulation in recent decades. This wasn't just a discovery; it was a testament to the harmonization of traditional methodologies with disruptive tech solutions.

Project management, in my playbook, is akin to software development: it's iterative, agile, and centered on collaborative teams. I pride myself on sculpting raw data into actionable insights, shaping visions into deliverables, and ensuring projects don't just end, but evolve.

To the tech visionaries, the disruptors, the dreamers, and the builders: If you're seeking a partner who understands the pulse of geoscience, the rhythm of data, and the art of project management and business, let's converse. With a legacy of pioneering achievements and an eye on the tech horizon, I'm eager to co-create, redefining boundaries and setting new industry benchmarks. Are you ready to shape the next tech revolution together?
